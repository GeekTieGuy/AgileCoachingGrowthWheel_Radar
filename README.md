# AgileCoachingGrowthWheel_Radar
A place to share a copy of work originally done by Fred Deichler and Adam Lund.

This is a stand-alone HTML / JavaScript combo.

To use it, simply clone the repo (or download the two files into the same folder),
then double-click the HTML file.

Adjust the values next to each competency (defaulted to values 1-5 for demonstration
purposes), then click the "Draw Wheel" button.

You'll get two graphs: one for self-mastery (a column chart) and one for the rest of the
competencies (a radar chart). Each can be exported to PNG with a button click.

The HTML makes use of browser local storage to remember your inputs from session to session
to make it easier to only tweak the values you feel you're making progress on each time you
want to update your graph.
